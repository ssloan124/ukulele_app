# Summary

Ukulele practice tailored to me

# Overview

Create an app that cycles through practice exercises based on chord progressions and strumming patterns.  This is to consolidate all of the different pages I had to access individually.

# Basic Usage

Notes: Docker and Docker-compose not currently working -- can't get ```imager```, ```Python3```, ```Shiny```, and ```Rstudio``` working in the same image

# Next Steps: 

* Incorporate metronome through Python ```music``` library
