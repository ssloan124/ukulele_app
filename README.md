# Summary

Ukulele practice tailored to me

# Overview

Create an app that cycles through practice exercises based on chord progressions and strumming patterns.  This is to consolidate all of the different pages I had to access individually.

# Basic Usage

(sudo) bash start.sh
go to localhost:3838 to view

# Next Steps: 

* Incorporate metronome through Python ```music``` library
